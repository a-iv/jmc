Even if the documentation is still pretty raw, 
it is nearly enough to start working on midlets!


Docs for the XMPP PARSER:

* parser_package.gif: describes the hooks, that's 
all you need to know to use the parser in your app!!

* parser_state_legend.gif: legend of the 
parser_state_diagram.gif file :)

* parser_state_diagram.gif: state diagram of the
finite state machine which runs the parser. Useful
if you want to modify the parser!


Docs for the midlet implementations:

* proxy_Design.gif: tells how to use the proxy.

* proxy_Development.gif: describes the internals
of the proxy, used only if you want to know exactly
how it works.

* threads.gif: threading architecture of the midlet.
kind of very usefull!
